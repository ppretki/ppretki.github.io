title: Domain Driven Design: Aggregate

# Invariants
>
An invariant is a business rule that must always be consistent. When trying to discover the Aggregates in a Bounded Context (2), we must understand the modelâ€™s
true invariants. Only with that knowledge can we determine which objects should be clustered into a
given Aggregate. Aggregate is synonymous with transactional consistency (immediate and atomic) boundary
