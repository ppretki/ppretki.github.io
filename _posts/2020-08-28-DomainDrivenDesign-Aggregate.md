title: Domain Driven Design - Aggregate

# Invariants
>
An invariant is a business rule that must always be consistent.

# Aggregate
>
Aggregate is synonymous with transactional consistency (immediate and atomic) boundary. When trying to discover the Aggregates in a Bounded Context, we must understand the modelâ€™s
true invariants. Only with that knowledge can we determine which objects should be clustered into a given Aggregate.

## Aggregate vs Transactions
>
Properly designed Aggregate is one that can be modified in any way required by the business with its
invariants completely consistent within a single transaction. And a properly designed Bounded Context
modifies only one Aggregate instance per transaction in all cases.
