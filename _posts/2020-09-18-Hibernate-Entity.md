# Identity

## Surrogate Id
>
Surrogate keys are generated independently of the current row data, so the other column constraints may freely evolve according to the application business requirements.

## Natural Id (Business Key)
>
Unique in the whole entity object space independent of any persistence technology. Its uniqueness is enforced by external factors
