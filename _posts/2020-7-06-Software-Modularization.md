title: Software Modularization

MODULES give people two views of the model: They can look at detail within a MODULE without being overwhelmed by the whole, or they can look at relationships between MODULES in views that exclude interior detail

Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality

You want your modules to work so that if I need to change part of a system, most of the time I only need to understand a small part of that system to make the change, and I can find that small part pretty easily

There are several ways to describe coupling, but it boils down to this: If changing
one module in a program requires changing another module, then coupling exists.

The code that changes together, stays together. We want the functionality grouped in such a way that we can make changes in as few places as possible.
Expose as little as possible from a module. Once something becomes part of a module interface, itâ€™s
hard to walk that back. But if you hide it now, you can always decide to share it later

## Modularity and deletion
>
To determine if a feature or aspect of a program is modular, just ask yourself this question: How many steps does it take to delete this feature? The fewer the steps, the more modular it is. If it takes only one step to delete a feature (usually by deleting a directory), then you can say that the design has maximum modularity
