## Software Components

>
Components are not a technology. Components are about how customers want to relate to software. They want to be able to buy their software a piece at a time, and to be able to upgrade it just like they can upgrade their stereo.

>
The important point is that components represent pieces that are independently purchasable and
upgradeable.

## UML notation

### Providing Interface

It is realized by the component, one of the classifiers realizing component or is provided by public port of the component - [complete definition](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/component.html#provided-interface)

### Requiring Interface

It is required by either component, one of the classifiers realizing component or its public port to work - [complete definition](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/component.html#required-interface)

### Port

A port specifies an interaction point through which a classifier can communicate with its environment.
Ports allow you to group the required and provided interfaces into logical interactions that a component has with the outside world.
