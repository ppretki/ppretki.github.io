I am one of these software developers who look back with a bit of nostalgia at the products like 
Turbo Pascal, Borland Turbo C, Turbo Assembler. Being in the business for a quite some time has given me 
a chance to change my professional mindset several times along the way. 

Like in any other profession also in software engineering we have heroes we learn from. 
So amongst my are: Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Robert C. Martin, Joshua Bloch, Adam Bien and Eric Evans.     
   
I like to think about myself as a software engineer which knows that software cannot be just written 
but must be designed in the first place. It follows straight from my experience that well-design 
software is not something that we usually come up with from the very beginning of a project. 
It is rather the goal that we achieve during systematic and repetitive process of witting code, 
taking a step back, being sceptical about what we have just done and writing slightly better code again.       

## About the blog

It is not really a blog. It is rather kind of engineering notebook in which I can preserve information 
that usually after several days becomes a bit blurry and after another several weeks completely disappears 
from my head.
